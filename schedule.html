He coordinates the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (ECNM) and runs a center of excellence for myeloid neoplasms and mast cell disorders. He organized a number of working conferences on diagnostic criteria and standards in mast cell neoplasms in Vienna in the past 25 years, resulting in consensus criteria and the WHO classification in mastocytosis. Special focus in his research are the identification of novel markers and targets in neoplastic mast cells and the development of diagnostic criteria and of targeted drug therapies in systemic mastocytosis and other myeloid neoplasms. Professor Valent is member in diverse medical societies, including the American Society of Hematology and serves in various editorial boards and as a reviewer in most top hematology journals. He published more than 900 peer-reviewed articles including numerous review articles and text book chapters in his areas of expertise, lectured widely in Europe and North America and received numerous scientific awards.</div>
