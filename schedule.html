He coordinates the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (ECNM) and runs a center of excellence for myeloid neoplasms and mast cell disorders. He organized a number of working conferences on diagnostic criteria and standards in mast cell neoplasms in Vienna in the past 25 years, resulting in consensus criteria and the WHO classification in mastocytosis. Special focus in his research are the identification of novel markers and targets in neoplastic mast cells and the development of diagnostic criteria and of targeted drug therapies in systemic mastocytosis and other myeloid neoplasms. Professor Valent is member in diverse medical societies, including the American Society of Hematology and serves in various editorial boards and as a reviewer in most top hematology journals. He published more than 900 peer-reviewed articles including numerous review articles and text book chapters in his areas of expertise, lectured widely in Europe and North America and received numerous scientific awards.</div>

Frank Austen, where I studied the initiation of allergic inflammation. I continued focusing on Th2 inflammation during my post-doctoral research with Dr. Nora Barrett at Brigham and Women's Hospital, where I focused on defining the transcriptional landscape of murine connective tissue mast cells and using single-cell RNA sequencing to define key cellular players and map mast cell heterogeneity within human nasal polyposis. I started my independent laboratory at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Fall 2019, where my research has focused on determining the signals that recruit mast cell progenitors from the circulation to inflamed tissues, understanding how these progenitors integrate tissue- and inflammation-associated signals to take on a range of discrete phenotypes, and discovering how heterogeneous mast cell phenotypes influence both tissue homeostasis and disease progression.</div>

These include identifying different types of mast cells; and discovering human α-, β-, and α/β-tryptases, characterizing their proteolytic activities, producing an anti-tryptase inhibitor of potential therapeutic utility, and inventing clinically useful tryptase immunoassays that facilitate the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis (FDA and WHO approved) and of anaphylaxis, the discovery and diagnosis of mast cell activation syndromes and of hereditary alpha-tryptasemia, and the monitoring of mast cell cytoreductive therapies. By caring for patients with such disorders and being involved in related basic, translational, and clinical research, he has a unique perspective to share.</div>

He graduated with a B.A. in Chemistry from Pomona College in 2003 and earned a Doctor of Medicine from the University of Southern California in 2007. Dr. Lyons completed residency training in Internal Medicine at the University of California, San Diego, in 2010, and served as a Chief Medical Resident in Internal Medicine in 2011. He concluded his formal medical training in 2014 at NIAID as a Clinical Fellow in Allergy and Immunology. Following completion of fellowship, Jonathan was selected for the NIAID Transition Program in Clinical Research, and he served as an Assistant Clinical Investigator in the Laboratory of Allergic Diseases (LAD) until 2018 when he was selected as a tenure-track PI. Beginning in 2018 Dr. Lyons served as the Chief of the Translational Allergic Immunopathology Unit in the LAD. where his lab uses a variety of genetic approaches in order to identify mechanisms and pathways critical to allergic inflammation and hypersensitivity that can be targeted to conduct first in human clinical trials. In 2023, Dr. Lyons moved his lab to UCSD where he is Professor of Medicine and continues his studies into the genetic underpinnings of severe allergic inflammation and reactions.</p> <p>In 2015 Dr. Lyons received the AAAAI Foundation / The Mastocytosis Society Research Award in Mastocytosis and/or Mast Cell Activation Syndrome and Dr. Lyons has received NIAID Merit Awards in 2016, 2017, and 2020 for his work related to the identification and characterization of hereditary alpha-tryptasemia as a common genetic trait and modifier of mast cell-associated diseases and reactions. Dr. Lyons was named a Lasker Scholar in 2018, in 2020 he received the Young Physician-Scientist Award from the American Society for Clinical Investigation, and in 2021 was awarded the Innovation in Research Award by The Mast Cell Disease Society.</p></div>

My research training is in hematopoiesis, focusing on blood stem cell biology in mouse hematopoiesis during my PhD (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York) and residency (Children's hospital of New York Presbyterian, Columbia University, New York) training, and zebrafish model of clonal hematopoiesis during my postdoctoral training after clinical fellowship (Boston Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). My lab focuses on understanding the effects of acquired mutations in the context of germline leukemia predisposition conditions like GATA2 deficiency, with a goal of studying clone-specific biology that could be targeted therapeutically. We use preclinical model of zebrafish and primary human cells to conduct our research through complementary approaches. My clinical focus is in pediatric stem cell transplantation and bone marrow failure syndromes with leukemia predisposition.</div>

Following his time at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Siracusa continued his training at the University of Pennsylvania where he made seminal discoveries defining the host protective functions of basophils and mast cells. In 2014 Dr. Siracusa was recruited to the Center for Immunity and Inflammation at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School as the Universities first Chancellor Scholar. Dr. Siracusa has established a successful NIH-funded research program that has made fundamental discoveries defining the diverse roles that granulocytes and neuroimmune interactions play in regulating type 2 inflammation. Dr. Siracusa also serves on the Innate Immunity and Inflammation Study Section and is the President and Founder of NemaGen Discoveries, a biotech start-up company that develops novel therapeutics based on pathways discovered in his laboratory. </div>

Dr. Cruse completed his Ph.D. at the University of Leicester, United Kingdom under the mentorship of Prof. Peter Bradding. During his Ph.D., he focused on human lung mast cell biology in asthma. He then moved to Bethesda, Maryland, as a postdoctoral fellow in the Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, NIAID at NIH where his research interest expanded to include mastocytosis and mast cell neoplasms under the guidance of Dr. Dean Metcalfe. In 2016, Dr. Cruse started his independent research program at NC State University. The goal of his NIH and industry-supported research program is to understand the role that mast cells play in allergic and inflammatory diseases, establish novel regulators of mast cell function, and develop targeted therapeutics for mast cell-mediated inflammatory and proliferative diseases.</div>
