The report was a warning to the EGLE leadership of the widespread contamination of the environment by perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and the dangers of human exposure to PFAS and other widespread contaminants in the environment. In the report, Mr. Delaney predicted the widespread contamination of Michigan’s drinking water and surface waters that are now being documented.  He also laid out a road map for addressing the PFAS contamination crisis.</p><p>Mr. Delaney has over 36 years of experience with EGLE.  He has provided regulatory oversight on the Department of Defense environmental restoration efforts at former and active bases in Michigan.  Since 2010 he has served on numerous state and national technical work groups studying and providing guidance on PFAS contamination. Currently he is retired and continues to provide volunteer help for communities impacted by PFAS contamination.</p></div>

Dana and her husband Michael's oldest daughter, Amara Strande, died last year at the age of 20 from a rare liver cancer. Amara believed her cancer was a result of PFAS contamination in our groundwater. The Strandes live on the world's largest known underground plume, which covers 260 square miles on the east side of St. Paul. Shortly before Amara died, she testified to 4 MN legislature committees for a bill to restrict PFAS from manufacturing and non-essential products in MN.  The bill passed just days after Amara's death and MN lawmakers named it Amara's Law.  Dana, Michael, and their daughter, Nora Strande, continue the fight for a PFAS-free environment. Nora has been working especially hard lobbying for a National MCL Clean Water Standard, ending the use of PFAS in women's feminine products, and interns at MN Clean Water Action.  Dana considers herself a part of her 3 person family team that carries out the work of environmental justice in honor of Amara and for all generations now and to come.</div>

Carrera (she/they) is an Associate Professor of Sociology and Environmental Science and Policy at Michigan State University. She holds a PhD in Sociology and two master’s degrees in Biostatistics and in Environmental Engineering. Her research focuses on environmental justice issues around water access and water quality, with an emphasis on low-income communities in the United States.  Dr. Carrera’s research interests focus on community capacity to lead environmental health and health equity research and the pathways through which academic partners can support community-led research agendas.  She uses a racial equity lens in considering the production and management of environmental health knowledge. Since 2015, Dr. Carrera has engaged in community-based participatory research with partners in Flint, Michigan. She received an NIH K01 career award to support her research and has won four prestigious university and national awards for her engaged scholarship in Flint. For the K01 project, Dr. Carrera learned Java and XML in order to code an Android mobile application directly with Flint residents who held a range of skills, including those with limited functional and technological literacy. By designing tools and report-backs for limited literacy audiences, Dr. Carrera adopts a universal design approach to science communication.</div>

It has continued through three more generations.  Through those years the family grew and the torch was handed down to the next generation.  In the early 70’s Jason’s parents bought more land and expanded the farm to where it is today.  In 1995 Jason’s Father, Jerry Sr., died in a tragic farming accident.  This left the farm to Jason’s Mother and the three boys to run since his Grandparents were no longer at the age that they could help.  It was soon after that Jason’s Mother decided that it was too difficult to continue as a dairy farm.  Two of her sons were going in different directions from working on the farm leaving her and Jason to manage the farm.</p> <p>After receiving his degree in dairy management from MSU Jason then stepped up and took the farm in a different direction and started to raise beef cattle and grow row crops to sell as cash crop.  He set up a breeding program and for the next five years the herd grew bigger and bigger each year.  In 2009 Jason expanded the business by getting his license to sell meat to the public.  This avenue started at the local Farmers Market selling packaged meat.  While Jason’s family grew so did his business.  Each year he sold more and more meat, continuing to sell at the farmer market, and directly from the farm selling larger packages like whole and half cows.  He included his wife and children every step of the way.  They would join him every Saturday at the farmers market helping to sell meat as well as help with the chores on the farm.</p></div>

She married her husband in 2014. She is a mother to 2 boys, one born in 2016 and the other in 2020. She worked as an elementary teacher for 7 years but now stays home with her children and 2 dogs. Tobyn loves being home in the house that was purchased in 2012 to start a life. However, her sanctuary was tarnished by the fact that 20 times the EPA limit of PFAS was found in the drinking well there in 2017. Since then, she has felt the need to take up a torch of advocacy work and spreading awareness of why and how PFAS is toxic. She has spoken to Representatives and Senators at both State and Federal levels. She has done a lot of work with the media and has attended conferences and panels regarding PFAS. She joined the Community Advisory Group in February of 2022 to help her community address this home-town as well as global issue.</div>

Specializing in environmental epidemiology, data science, and physiology, his research focuses on uncovering the negative health impacts of PFAS and other environmental chemicals, particularly among racial/ethnic minorities and other vulnerable groups. By applying state of the art molecular biology techniques into his epidemiological studies, he seeks to understand the biological processes through which PFAS cause health issues. By understanding the mechanisms of PFAS associated adverse health effects, his research aims to develop methods to help identify individuals at highest risk of PFAS induced liver and kidney disease and to inform on new strategies to mitigate PFAS-related health risks in underserved populations.</div>

In 1997, Kris and her team “discovered” the global contamination of PFAS, specifically via 3M’s signature PFAS molecule, PFOS, first in the blood of the general population and then in the broader environment, including water, birds, fish and mammals.  Within a year, the team had identified and characterized over a dozen PFAS compounds in the environment.  During the next 3 years (through 2001), Kris provided technical leadership pursuing the extent and sources of PFAS contamination within a high stress and highly political environment at 3M.</p> <p>In consensus with 3M lab management and amidst an increasingly confined work environment, Kris left the Environmental Lab in 2001 to pursue other opportunities within 3M.   Following review of now public disclosures from 3M (specifically, those available via the Attorney General of MN following settlement of 2018 litigation between 3M and Minnesota), Kris began to document examples of “unseen” and “undone” science perpetrated in what she perceives to be 3M’s quest to manufacture doubt around their role in creating and covering up 3M’s role in PFAS global contamination.</p> <p>As a new employee working as an “outsider” inside 3M, Kris experienced anxiety, fear, and self doubt resulting from persistent questions about her loyalty, competence, and integrity and from what she perceived as intentional misdirection from company leadership.</p></div>

My research focuses on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and their hazards and risks to the environment. For this I'm looking at different aspects of their environmental behaviors like their emissions, their distribution in the environment and their environmental concentrations. My previous projects focused mainly on polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated paraffins, which replaced PCBs as additives in most of the applications after the mid-1980s. The focus of my current work is on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).  With regard to PFAS, I am primarily focusing on applications of PFAS and alternatives to PFAS, but also on emissions and the occurrence of PFAS in the environment. I am also participating as an observer in the meetings of the Risk Assessment Committee (RAC) and Socio-Economic Assessment Committee (SEAC) of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for the discussions on the PFAS restriction proposal in the EU.</div>

I was educated at Michigan State University, Indiana University, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. After 15 years as faculty at East Carolina University, I joined Oregon State University in the fall of 2023 as faculty and as Director of the Pacific Northwest Center for Translational Environmental Health Research (a Center dedicated to growing environmental health science research in the northwest region). Within my lab's PFAS research program, we are especially interested in trying to get to the bottom of two questions: 1) Why does exposure to some PFAS decrease the ability of the immune system to make antibodies following a vaccination? 2) Do PFAS that have not been well-studied for their health effects also affect the antibody response to a vaccination? We hope that in working to answer these two questions we can help affected community members, other scientists, and decision-makers appreciate that effects of PFAS exposure on the immune system are real health risks and work together to inform public health policies that protect the immune system from PFAS exposures.</div>
